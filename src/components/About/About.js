                <p>Prima interactiune cu programarea a inceput in 2009, cand am creat primul meu website, pe atunci nu eram foarte atras de programare si nu mi-am dat seama ca pot sa traiesc din asta.
                    Recent am vazut un anunt despre un scholarship pentru a invata Web Development.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    My first interaction with code was in 2009 when I created my first website, back then I was not thinking that I can do my living from it.

                Recently I saw an ad on Facebook about a scholarship program to learn web development. I read some information about that and I registered for the scholarship. One month passed and they announced the people selected for this program -- 60,000 out of the 200,000 registered.

                The funny part of this is that I received an email telling me that I was not selected for this program, and I felt so bad in that day. But the very next day they send me a second email telling me that the first email was a mistake and I was selected.

                The scholarship start date came and, after a few weeks Iâ€™ve learned so much and was so motivated to learn more about programing, that I completed the 3 month scholarship program in only 1 month. The course was so well put together and the community always there to help when I got stuck in some quizzes.

                When the scholarship was over, the next step was to announce the recipients of a 6 months nanodegree program. That day was the longest day of my life. The email came telling me that I was one of the 10% of 60,000 people who moved on to phase 2 of the scholarship -- 6 months of learning Front-End Web Development. It was the best thing that happened to me, and for this I want to thank Udacity for showing me a path to follow, that I had not seen before, and did not know existed.</p></div>
